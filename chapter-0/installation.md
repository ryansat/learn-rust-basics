Installing Rust and its package manager, Cargo, is made easy through a tool called `rustup`. `rustup` is a version management tool for Rust that allows you to install and switch between multiple versions of the Rust toolchain.

To install Rust and Cargo, follow these instructions for each operating system:

**Windows:**

1. Go to the [Install Rust page](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and follow the instructions for Windows.
2. Download and run the "rustup-init.exe" file and follow the onscreen instructions.
3. To verify your installation, open a new command prompt and type the following command: `rustc --version`. This should return the version of Rust that you installed.

**Windows with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux):**

1. First, you need to have WSL installed. If you haven't, you can follow the instructions in the [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to install it.
2. Once you have WSL installed and set up, open a new WSL terminal.
3. Follow the instructions for Linux below.

**macOS:**

1. If you have Homebrew installed, you can install Rust by running `brew install rustup` and then `rustup-init`.
2. Otherwise, go to the [Install Rust page](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and follow the instructions for macOS.
3. To verify your installation, open a new terminal and type the following command: `rustc --version`. This should return the version of Rust that you installed.

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**

1. Open a terminal.
2. Download and install `rustup` by running the following command: `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
3. The above command will download a script and start the installation. You will be prompted to proceed with the installation. Press "1" and then "Enter" to proceed with the default installation.
4. Once the installation is complete, close the terminal and open a new one.
5. Add the `cargo` binary path to your `PATH` with this command: `source $HOME/.cargo/env`
6. To verify your installation, type the following command: `rustc --version`. This should return the version of Rust that you installed.

Once you have Rust and Cargo installed, you can install the Rocket framework by adding it as a dependency in your Rust project. To do this:

1. Navigate to your project directory in your terminal.
2. Open the `Cargo.toml` file in a text editor.
3. Add the following lines to the `[dependencies]` section of the file:

```toml
[dependencies]
rocket = "0.5.0-rc.1"
```

4. Save and close the `Cargo.toml` file.
5. Back in your terminal, run the command `cargo build`. This will download and compile the Rocket framework and any other dependencies listed in your `Cargo.toml` file.
