`cargo` is the Rust package manager. It's an extremely useful tool that allows you to build, test, and manage dependencies in your Rust projects. Here are some of the key functionalities of `cargo`:

1. **Creating a new Rust project:** You can use `cargo` to create a new Rust project with a pre-set directory structure and a simple "Hello, World!" program. The command for this is `cargo new my_project`, where "my_project" is the name of your new project. This will create a new directory called "my_project" with the basic files and directories you'll need.

2. **Building your project:** `cargo build` is the command to compile your project. This command creates an executable file in `target/debug/` with the same name as your project. You can run this file to execute your program. If you want to build for release with optimizations, you can use `cargo build --release`.

3. **Running your project:** `cargo run` is a command that builds your project and runs it immediately. This is a convenient way to test your code as you're working on it.

4. **Checking your project:** If you want to quickly check your code for errors without producing an executable, you can use `cargo check`. This command is faster than `cargo build` because it doesn't create an executable.

5. **Testing your project:** Rust has a built-in testing framework that you can use to write unit tests for your code, and `cargo test` is the command that runs those tests.

6. **Managing dependencies:** If your project depends on external crates (which are what libraries are called in Rust), you can list them in your `Cargo.toml` file under the `[dependencies]` section. `cargo` will automatically download and compile your dependencies when you build your project.

7. **Generating documentation:** You can generate HTML documentation for your Rust project (including all its dependencies) using `cargo doc`. You can open the resulting HTML in your web browser to read the documentation.

8. **Publishing a crate:** If you've written a library in Rust that you want to share with the world, you can publish it on [crates.io](https://crates.io/), the Rust package registry, using `cargo publish`.

These are just some of the most common uses of `cargo`. It's a powerful tool with many more features that you can learn about in the [official `cargo` documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/).
