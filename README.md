# Learn Rust: A Beginner's Guide

Hello! My name is Fajar Satria, and this is my beginner's guide to the Rust programming language. This guide also covers some basics of Cargo, Rust's package manager, and the Rocket web framework.

Rust is a modern, fast, and memory-safe language that aims to make systems programming more accessible to everyone.

## Getting Started with Rust

Rust is easy to install and comes with a great toolchain. You can install Rust on Windows, Linux, and macOS using a tool called `rustup`.

- **Windows users:** Download and run ["rustup-init.exe"](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and follow the onscreen instructions.
- **Linux/WSL users:** Run `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh` in your terminal and follow the prompts.
- **macOS users:** If you have Homebrew installed, you can run `brew install rustup` and then `rustup-init`. Otherwise, follow the same steps as Windows users.

After installation, you can verify it by typing `rustc --version` in a new terminal.

## Cargo, the Rust Package Manager

Cargo is the package manager for Rust. It comes with your Rust installation and it allows you to do many things like:

- **Creating Projects:** `cargo new my_project`
- **Building Projects:** `cargo build`
- **Running Projects:** `cargo run`
- **Testing Projects:** `cargo test`
- **Generating Documentation:** `cargo doc`

And much more. It's an essential tool for any Rust programmer.

## Rocket, a Web Framework for Rust

Rocket is a web framework for Rust that makes it easy to write fast and secure web applications. Note: as of the last update to this guide, Rocket requires a nightly build of Rust. You can set your project to use the nightly toolchain with `rustup override set nightly`.

Here's a simple "Hello, world!" example using Rocket:

```rust
#[macro_use] extern crate rocket;

#[get("/")]
fn hello() -> &'static str {
    "Hello, world!"
}

#[launch]
fn rocket() -> _ {
    rocket::build().mount("/", routes![hello])
}
```

This example creates a new Rocket application that responds with "Hello, world!" when you access the root ("/") URL.
